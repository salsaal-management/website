	<p>Salsaal Integration Association was founded in August 2014 by a group of like-minded and committed Afghans in Western Australia. SIA is a non-for-profit organisation aims to provide extensive ranges of cultural, educational and recreational programs and promote awareness between people of diverse communities in Western Australia. SIA empowers the learning opportunities of the Perth Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CaLD) residents, especially the Afghans, by organising cultural events such as New Year (Nowrooz) eve and Eid; educational programs such as offering free Dari, Hazaragi and English programs for new arrivals refugees and children;  women empowerment programs such as celebrating International Women Day; empowering students and youth in the community such as establishing Curtin Salsaal Student Association and organising football and other sport tournaments; and organising other civic and recreational programs to promote awareness and respect between people of different communities in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
	<p>Mr. Shoukat Lali became the first elected interim President of SIA with responsibilities to register the organisation with the Department of Commerce and initiate necessary arrangement for the next stage to elect a new President with full capacity. After being registered with the Department of Commerce, under Associations Incorporation Act 1987 in November 2014, SIA formally began promoting its activities in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
	<p>In February 2015, Deedar Khudaidad was elected as President to carry on the activities of SIA with full capacity. After celebrating the International Women’s Day in March 2015 and organising other cultural events, SIA quickly became popular for its extensive ranges of cultural, educational and recreational programs implemented at the North and Southern suburbs of Perth. Since then, SIA’s dedicated members are tirelessly working to bring new initiatives in the community, expanding SIA’s activities around Perth and state-wide, and making sure our people in the community receive necessary services.</p>
